# eBeer Mobile

This repository now includes a simple Flutter front end located in `flutter_app/`.
The Flutter app demonstrates how a mobile application can be built for the
existing Django backend.

## Running the Flutter App

1. Install Flutter on your machine.
2. From the `flutter_app` directory run `flutter run` to launch the app.

The app currently displays a basic home page but can be extended to fetch data
from the Django API endpoints.
